# EvotingExplorer

I was wondering what was stored in the skipchain that is used for the EPFL e-voting project.
And I wanted to know how many ballots have been cast, and whether my ballot has been included.
So I wrote this small explorer that shows all the elections available on the servers,
as well as the information of the ballots.
Of course the ballot itself is encrypted, so even if the content of the vote is displayed,
one cannot discover what each person voted.
